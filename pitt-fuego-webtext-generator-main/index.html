<h2>A Form of Rebellion</h2>
  <h3>Hactivism emerged as an illegal way to interfere with digital media for a variety of different motives, often political and social. <a href=""></a> The most well known activist platform that comes to mind for most is the group called <em>Annonymous</em> <em></em>. They have been known to hack government agencies and even the Church of Scientology to expose private information kept from the public. This group runs on a free speech platform and believes in the uncensoring of information<a href="https://pitt-fuego.github.io/Pitt-Fuego-Coding-Tools/"></a>.</h3>

          <p><em>The offical slogan of Annonymous</em></p>
  </div>

  </<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Zero Trace</h2>
    <h3>Annonymous has created a "look" for their group in the sense that they potray themselves as these unindentifiable beings behind a mask. They will often times use voice changers or text-to-speech programs when virtually addressing the public. This adds a mysterous facade as they are seen as limitless and all knowing beings. Some say that their use of hacking reflect anarchal values that a number of people have come to support and respect.

      <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
      <h2>Why is this an Art?</h2>
        <h3> While the work of annonymous is descrete, it can still be considered an art of new media. Not only is their work highly complex, but the results are typically both shocking and enticing to all. It is neither visual nor physical but their work sparks conversation and allows the public to question authority, leading to a rise in even more New Media.
